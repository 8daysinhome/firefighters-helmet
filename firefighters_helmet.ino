You see, when the GPS module starts up, it typically requires a warm-up period during which it waits to acquire satellite positioning. This process can take anywhere from several minutes to even hours. In the context of our demonstrations or quick showcases, we don't have the luxury of waiting for the GPS to complete its warm-up and obtain accurate real-time positioning. Hence, these preset values are used here to mimic the presence of valid GPS location data for the purpose of demonstrating related functions. They are not the actual, accurate GPS coordinates but serve as a temporary substitute to allow for a smoother presentation of the overall functionality without the need to endure the potentially lengthy warm-up process.  #define GPS_dataE "40.12.55"
